## 🎮 Inspiration  
Classic arcade games like *Asteroids* and *Space Invaders* have stood the test of time. While modern gamers enjoy remasters with enhanced graphics, many new releases suffer from unnecessary bloat, required web services, and microtransactions that detract from the core gameplay experience. This project reimagines *Asteroids* in 3D while keeping the gameplay pure and engaging.  

## 🕹️ What It Does  
A modern 3D take on the *Space Invaders* arcade style, blending classic mechanics with immersive visuals and dynamic gameplay.  

## 🛠️ How We Built It  
- **3D Assets**: Modeled in Blender to create a visually appealing experience.  
- **Game Engine**: Developed using Unity, leveraging its physics, rendering, and input systems.  
- **Core Features**: Implemented movement controls, enemy logic, and a 3D user interface for a seamless player experience.  

## ⚠️ Challenges We Ran Into  
- Unity's version control caused setbacks during collaboration.  
- While Unity provides powerful functionality, certain constraints required creative workarounds.  

## 🏆 Accomplishments We're Proud Of  
- Developed a fully functional 3D *Asteroids* game with polished assets and an intuitive interface.  
- Overcame technical challenges to maintain modularity and scalability in our code.  

## 📚 What We Learned  
- Efficient use of **Unity's version control**.  
- Designing for **modularity and scalability**.  
- Creating **PBR materials** and **programmable shaders**.  
- Game-optimized **3D modeling techniques**.  
- Utilizing **AI-generated prompts** to assist in development.  

## 🚀 What's Next?  
- Implementing **difficulty settings**, customizable **key binds**, and refined **controls**.  
- Adding **new game modes**, **boss battles**, and **extra mechanics** for deeper gameplay.  
- Further **polishing the UI and gameplay experience**.
